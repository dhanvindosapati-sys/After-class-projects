           <h2>Facts About Motor Bikes</h2>
              <p>Motorbikes, also known as motorcycles, are two-wheeled vehicles that are powered by an engine. They are popular for their speed, agility, and fuel efficiency. Motorbikes come in various styles, including sport bikes, cruisers, touring bikes, and dirt bikes. They are used for commuting, racing, and recreational purposes. Riding a motorbike requires skill and safety precautions, such as wearing a helmet and protective gear.</p>
           <h4>About Kawasaki Bikes <p><strong>In 1878, Shozo Kawasaki founded the Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard in Tokyo, Japan—the site for technological innovations for the shipping industry.

Then came the 1960s, when Kawasaki dipped its toes into the motorcycle industry. It produced its first bike in 1962 and soon merged with the Meguro Manufacturing Co. to form Kawasaki Motorcycle Co., Ltd., in 1963.

Since then, Kawasaki has been a popular name in the industry and has stood the test of time while producing a range of motorcycles. The brand and Universal Technical Institute (UTI) developed a relationship that led to the creation of the K-Tech specialized training program in 1989.</strong></p></article></h4>
